# Remove Duplicates

Given an array of integers that contains duplicate values, create a function that removes the duplicates.

01 - The first algorithm has O(n<sup>2</sup>) performance due to the nested loop

02 - The second algorithm has O(n) performance; we have to iterate through all values in the array

03 - The third algorithm has O(n) performance; although the hashtable provides constant time loopkup, we need to iterate through all the values
